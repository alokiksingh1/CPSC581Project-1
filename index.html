            In a magical place where oceans floated in the sky, Momo the panda had the time of his
life. Riding on a lily pad, he slid on sparkling waves, laughing as he went through waterfalls.
Dolphins jumped around him, leaving trails of sparkly light, and Momo tried to jump like
them. When night came, he rested among glowing jellyfish that lit up the sky. Momo's day
was filled with wonder and joy in this upside-down ocean world.
